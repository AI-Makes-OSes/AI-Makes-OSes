# Welcome to AI Makes OSes!
This is a small project by one singular developer who thought it would be interesting to see how AI would fare against making operating systems.

... And by that I mean uBlue (Universal Blue) images.

I'm gonna be honest, I cannot be bothered to prompt my way into a full OS from scratch, nor am I confident it to even be possible currently.

And given in these past few weeks I've had a *biiiiiit* of an obsession with uBlue + wanting to see the state of vibe-coding at this point in time as a trad-coder, this project was born.

## How this works
In the coming weeks two repos will likely be made, one in which the guidelines are written an AI (base image, bundled software, desktop environment (if applicable), ...), and the other where I write those guidelines myself.

Then, those guidelines are passed to Copilot, which will then use them to modify the uBlue template in accordance.

## Should I use these im-
No. Nope. Nu-uh. Absolutely not. Don't think about it.

Do **NOT** use them yourself, do **NOT** put your friends and family in them, just look at it, point and laugh, or find it interesting I dunno, I'm not your mom.

Jokes aside, there's literally no quality control here, I just blindly pushed whatever the AI generated, not to mention the fact that once a repo is up and finished, I will not be bothered to keep it up to date.
